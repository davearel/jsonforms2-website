The UI schema, which is passed to JSON Forms, describes the general layout of a form and is just a regular JSON object.
It describes the form by means of different UI schema elements, which can often be categorized into either Controls or Layouts.

Some UI schema elements allow an `options` property which allows for further configuration of the rendering result. The actual configuration options are often renderer specific and hence need to be looked up.

## Available elements

- [Controls](/docs/uischema/controls)
- [Layouts](/docs/uischema/layouts)
- [Rules](/docs/uischema/rules)
